# Epilog-AirAssist
Upgrade the air assist system for Epilog laser cutter, for a better sound environment. 

## Intro

For years staff and students within the Fab Lab here in Akureyri have been slowly going insane. There are multiple reasons for this of course, but one of which is the constant `CHK-CHK-CHK-CHK` sound of the recommended air assist pumps that go with our two Epilog laser cutting machines we have here.

## Investigation

Driven to despair, I decided to take a closer look at the air assist system.

Let's zoom in a little closer:

Relevant information shown here: `30 psi`

When I removed the backplate form the cutter, I found this air valve/solenoid:

## Operation of the valve

The default operation is to let the air escape freely through the outlet when the machine is not cutting. Once the machine starts cutting, the solenoid is engaged and the air passes to the nozzle. 

This means the pump is constantly running, consuming electricity and generating noise.
